# Quick Start

### Step 0 - Install Git & clone this repository

Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

`Command prompt: git clone https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant.git`


### Step 1 - Install Jupyter Notebook

https://jupyter.org/install.html

### Step 2 - Install additional required libraries

`Command prompt: pip3 install plotly`

### Step 3 - Create api.key file

This file is required to access StocksCafe APIs (Note: This is limited to only Friends of StocksCafe)

Please check [sample.api.key](https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant/blob/master/sample.api.key) for the formatting. Basically, just two lines. First line would be your StocksCafe username. Second line would be your API key which can be found on https://stocks.cafe/user/profile
(Note: If it is showing that your API Key is NULL, please click on the "Renew API Key" link)

Please keep the api.key file in the same directory as sample.api.key

### Step 4 - Have fun!
