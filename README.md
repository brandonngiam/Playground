https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

<br/>

### Step 2 - Clone this repository

Command prompt: `git clone https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant.git`

<br/>

### Step 3 - Install Jupyter Notebook

<br/>

### Step 4 - Install additional required libraries

<br/>

### Step 5 - Edit api-key.txt file

Please open api-key.txt (located where you clone the repository to in step 2) and replace the entire first line with your StocksCafe username, and the entire second line with your API key, which can be found on https://stocks.cafe/user/profile
(if your API Key is NULL, please click on the "Renew API Key" link).

Please save changes and close the api-key.txt file.

### Step 6 - Have fun!

Command prompt: `jupyter notebook`

I recommended to start with [this notebook](https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant/blob/master/%5Bevankoh%5D%20Plot%20Moving%20Average%20Chart.ipynb)

<br/>

# If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook

I highly recommend this easy to follow [lecture by Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/introduction-to-research)

<br/>

# (Optional) If you want to learn more about python

I recommend to read [this tutorial](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/python/basics.html)
