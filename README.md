# Quick Start (to install on your local drive)

### Step 1 - Install Git

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

<br/>

### Step 2 - Clone this repository

Command prompt: `git clone https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant.git`

<br/>

### Step 3 - Install Jupyter Notebook

https://jupyter.org/install.html

<br/>

### Step 4 - Install additional required libraries

Command prompt: `pip install plotly` (or `pip3 install plotly` if pip fails)

<br/>

### Step 5 - Edit sample.api-key.txt and rename it to api-key.txt

1) Please rename sample.api-key.txt to api-key.txt (sample.api-key.txt is located where you clone the repository to in Step 2)

2) Replace the entire first line with your StocksCafe username, and the entire second line with your API key, which can be found on https://stocks.cafe/user/profile
(if your API Key is NULL, please click on the "Renew API Key" link).

Note: API keys are available only to Friends of StocksCafe.

### Step 6 - Have fun!

Command prompt: `jupyter notebook`

I recommend to start with [this notebook](https://github.com/StocksCafe/Quant/blob/master/%5Bevankoh%5D%20Plot%20Moving%20Average%20Chart.ipynb)

# If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook

I highly recommend this easy to follow [lecture by Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/introduction-to-research)

# (Optional) If you want to learn more about python
